To Do:
-Deal with for(o:N) type loops in C++
-Final methods == const?
-change printStringDescendants to visitor methods
-Ask Grimm if we can rely on the same ordering of nodes in AST (ie. is methodsDeclaration)
-Manually do work of printStringDescendants with visitMethods()

-Ask Grimm: When we declare a __Array in our .h, do we need to specify size?

-Deal with matrices (arrays of arrays? OF ARRAYS??)
-be observant of use of string/class/object

-remember all classes need a pointer to a vtable
    - all methods for the class need to be declared in the vtable
